        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>This Ecma Standard is based on several originating technologies, the most well known being JavaScript
            (Netscape) and JScript (Microsoft). The language was invented by Brendan Eich at Netscape and first appeared
            in that company's Navigator 2.0 browser.
            It has appeared in all subsequent browsers from Netscape and in all browsers from Microsoft starting with
            Internet Explorer 3.0. The development of this Standard started in November 1996. The first edition of this
            Ecma Standard was adopted by the
            Ecma General Assembly of June 1997.</p>

        <p>That Ecma Standard was submitted to ISO/IEC JTC 1 for adoption under the fast-track procedure, and approved
            as international standard ISO/IEC 16262, in April 1998. The Ecma General Assembly of June 1998 approved the
            second edition of ECMA-262 to keep
            it fully aligned with ISO/IEC 16262. Changes between the first and the second edition are editorial in
            nature.</p>

        <p>The third edition of the Standard introduced powerful regular expressions, better string handling, new
            control statements, try/catch exception handling, tighter definition of errors, formatting for numeric
            output and minor changes in anticipation
            of forthcoming internationalisation facilities and future language growth. The third edition of the
            ECMAScript standard was adopted by the Ecma General Assembly of December 1999 and published as ISO/IEC
            16262:2002 in June 2002.</p>

        //1.JavaScript 中存在许多属性让我们能够读取元素的宽度、高度或其他具有几何特征的信息。
        //在移动或定位 JavaScript 元素时，我们经常需要它们来计算元素的坐标。

        //2.上例图片演示了当元素有滚动条时最复杂的情况，一些浏览器（不是全部）通过牺牲内容空间来保留滚动条。
        //因此，没有滚动条时，内容宽度将是 300 px，但是如果滚动条宽度是 16px（不同的设备和浏览器，宽度可能会不一样），
        //那么还剩下 300 - 16＝284px，这是我们必须考虑到的事.

        //3.几何学
        let div = document.querySelector('#example')
        console.log(div.offsetLeft) //20px
        console.log(div.offsetTop)  //30px
